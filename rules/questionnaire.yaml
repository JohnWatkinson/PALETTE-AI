# Signal Processing Notes:
#
# Each answer provides weighted signals toward:
# - undertone: warm, cool, neutral
# - value: light, medium, deep
# - chroma: bright, muted, soft, rich
# - contrast: high, medium, low
#
# The algorithm sums signals across all questions
# to determine the dominant characteristics,
# then maps to the appropriate season.
